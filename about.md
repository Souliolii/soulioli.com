  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>This is my personal archive for notes, projects, experiments, and things worth saving.</p>

    <p>I started this as a simple logbook, but it is now a broader home for my interests: software, systems, web projects, game notes, and everything in between.</p>
    <p>If it is useful to anyone else, great. If not, it still works as my long-term memory.</p>
